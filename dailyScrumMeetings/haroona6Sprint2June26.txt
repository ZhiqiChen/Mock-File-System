What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Worked on my tasks i-1, e-1, f-1, h-1

What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
    - Finish the remaining commands
    - Test the code and improve design

Am I blocked on anything?
   - To finish h-1 the intrepreter, need all of the commands to be completed
   - Also to finish i-1 (all the error checking), all the commands need to be completed
