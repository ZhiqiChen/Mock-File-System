//Sprint 2 Backlog. by Zhiqi Chen
June 27 to July 4th

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) Display error messages to user if input is incorrect or issues with input (Jshell)
b) Allow user to put a sentence typed into the terminal into a file creating the file (if it doesn't exist already) in 
the process (echo)
B) Allow user to put a sentence into a file that already exists, overwriting all contents of the file in the process
Bb) Allow user to put a sentence into a file that already exists, just adding that sentence to the end of the contents of the file
d) Parse user input through an interpreter (command handler)
e) traversal of file system (fileTraversal)
f) allow user to change directory (cd)


Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. print error messages from incorrect input taken from command handler
a-2. print error messages from faulty input that the classes reject.
b-1. Create a new file
b-2  Get user input into the file (remember to ignore the double quotes)
b-3. if no outfile specified print to shell
B-1. Search for file if it exists
B-2. If file exists, overwrite contents of the file with the user input
Bb-1. Recognize from user input if the user wants to append input to the end of a file
Bb-2. Append user input to the end of the specified file
c-1. test all functions
d-1. give correct input to classes 
e-1. allow user to traverse through the file system and allow
creation of the path given (fileTraversal)
e-2. this must be absolute path. 
f-1 create cd.java and allow user to change directories from current to the new directory
f-2. allow for relative and absolute path
