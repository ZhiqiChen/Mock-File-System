//Sprint 2 Backlog. by Zhiqi Chen
July 11 to july 17

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) allow user to recursively print contents of file or
the specified directory or current directory. (ls)
b)save the JShell as it	currently is to be loaded in ANOTHER SESSION by the 
load command (save)
c)  allow user to search files or directory in specified directories (find)
d) move location of a directory or file. If mv on a directory, recursively
move all elements (mv)
e) like move, but do not delete the old location (cp)
f) Update cat to be able to take multiple arguments (cat)
g) allow user to add a file from the a web address to working directory (get URL)
h)allow user to display the entire file system as a 
tree starting from the root directory (tree)
i) testing pwd and history
j) Update the existing commands to inherit from a generic parent class
k)allow user to use > and >> to either take output and store  
and append to a file specified. If no file is specified
output error message (all program)
